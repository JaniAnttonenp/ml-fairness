# Examples

The three environments currently released with ML-fairness-gym (college admission,
lending, and attention allocation) each have a set of experiments included in
the examples folder. Currently, these experiments are from the KDD Explainable
AI workshop paper "Fairness is Not Static" and running the main files will
reproduce those results.

These experiments should provide examples of ways ML-fairness-gym can be used to
investigate long term outcomes of ml-based interventions in a variety of toy
scenarios.

More information about how to run the experiments and what they explore can be
found here:
